        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="content">
            <b>Tony Tony Chopper</b>, also known as <b>"Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper</b>, is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the sixth member of the crew and the fifth to join, doing so at the end of the Drum Island Arc. He was temporarily forced to join the Foxy Pirates during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid or a human at will. He came from Drum Island and was taught how to be a doctor by his two parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk and Kureha. His dream is to one day become a doctor capable of curing any disease and wants to travel all across the world specifically in the hopes of accomplishing this dream.
            He currently has a bounty of B100 due to being mistaken for the crew's pet.

        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p class="content">
            Most of the time, Chopper is a toddler-sized human/reindeer hybrid, but his Devil Fruit abilities allow him to change his appearance depending on the situation. Chopper's left antler is braced at the base by a metal plate because it was reattached after being broken during his search for the Amiudake when he was younger (where he thought the Amiudake can cure Hiriluk's disease) and ran into the leader of his old herd, who severely injured him. He usually wears a large pale red/pink fuzzy top hat with a sideways medical cross (given to him by Hiriluk) and a maroon pair of shorts. He also sometimes wears a blue backpack that has the same sideways medical cross as his hat. He also has a remarkable blue nose. As Oda's style evolved and many readers commented on how cute Chopper was, Chopper has been given a much more "chibi" like appearance, meaning that when in his preferred transformation (which he calls <b>Brain Point</b>), he has a larger head and eyes and a less defined muzzle than earlier in the series. Many female characters, such as Nami, Robin, Makino, Porche, Shakky, and Vivi find Chopper very cute. There are even males that find Chopper cute such as Foxy and Breed.

            Similar to most of his male crewmates, Chopper has the same outfit throughout most of the series.
            In the Arabasta Arc, he wore a shirt with a green-lined collar, then a bigger one with giant sleeves that is light blue with dark blue liners.
            In the Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a red leather jacket.
            In the Post Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a blue t-shirt.
        </p>
        <p>
            After two years, Chopper is significantly leaner. He is less potbellied than he was in earlier seasons and his arms/forelimbs are also skinnier. It is arguable that since leaving the cold climate on Drum Island, he has lost significant body fat. The color of his fur has changed from brown to gold, and according to Nami (when she and Chopper reunite on Sabaody), the texture has gotten softer.
