          Here some awesome facts about chocolate cookies!
          <ol>
            <li>
              The chocolate chip cookie was created by accident. In the 1930s,
              Ruth Wakefield, owner of the Toll House Inn in Whitman,
              Massachusetts, added broken chocolate bar pieces into her cookie
              batter thinking that they would melt. Instead, the classic dessert
              was born.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chocolate chip cookies were first called "Butterdrop Do Cookies."
              Wakefield's recipe first ran in a Boston newspaper. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The first chocolate chip cookie was the size of a quarter. It was
              super crispy and could be devoured in just one bite.
            </li>
            <li>
              The creator of the cookie was paid for her recipe with a lifetime
              supply of chocolate from Nestlé.
            </li>
            <li>
              The world's biggest chocolate chip cookie weighed 40,000 pounds
              and had a diameter of 101 feet.

      Here's the cookie to bake when you want to impress your friends at the
      cookie swap but you're not about to spend hours cutting out reindeers and
      piping royal icing. The big puddles of chocolate offer drama—and tell the
      tale of the super chocolatey, gooey insides. The best part is that there's
      no real planning ahead necessary: After just one hour of resting, these
      cookies are ready for the oven.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>5 2-oz. bittersweet chocolate bars (preferably 65%-75% cacao)</li>
      <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1.5 cups (235 g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp. (5 g) baking soda</li>
      <li>1/3 cup (38 g) Dutch-processed cocoa powder</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (170 g; packed) dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1.5 tsp. (6 g) kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp. (22 g) vanilla paste or extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your 2 large eggs need to be at room temperature for this recipe. If
          they aren’t, put them in a small bowl and cover them with hot tap
          water. This’ll bring them up to speed quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coarsely chop four 2-oz. chocolate bars. You want them to be bigger
          than normal chocolate chips (aim for 3–4 times the size)—this creates
          the chocolate puddles. Set aside. Chop remaining 2-oz. chocolate bar
          into 20-ish pieces (you’re going to place one or two pieces atop each
          cookie).
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut 2 sticks unsalted butter into large pieces. Cook in a medium
          saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often, until it foams, then
          browns, 7–9 minutes. (Watch carefully since browned butter goes from
          brown to black in the blink of an eye.) Immediately scrape into a
          large bowl and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          While butter cools, whisk 1⅔ cups all-purpose flour and 1 tsp. baking
          soda in a medium bowl to combine. Press ⅓ cup cocoa powder through a
          fine-mesh sieve into bowl (this eliminates those pesky lumps), then
          whisk again to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add ¾ cup brown sugar, ¼ cup granulated sugar, and 1½ tsp. kosher salt
          to browned butter. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, stir
          vigorously to combine. Add 1 large egg and whisk vigorously until
          incorporated, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining 1 large egg, then
          whisk in 1 Tbsp. vanilla paste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Switch back to your spatula or spoon to stir in dry ingredients just
          to combine. Mix in the 4 chopped chocolate bars you set aside. Let
          dough sit at room temperature at least 1 hour to let flour and cocoa
          hydrate. The dough will thicken as it sits.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°. Line 2 baking sheets
          with parchment paper. Shape dough into ping-pong sized balls (about 3
          Tbsp.). Arrange on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 3" apart.
          Lightly press a chunk or two of remaining chocolate on top of each
          dough ball.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake cookies, rotating pans top to bottom and front to back halfway
          through, until edges are just set but centers are still soft, 8–10
          minutes. Remove from oven and carefully tap pan on stovetop to deflate
          and flatten cookies. Let cool on baking sheets 10 minutes, then
          transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer cookies to a platter. Serve and enjoy!</li>
